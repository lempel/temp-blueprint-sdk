Background:
<br>
<br>
blueprint-sdk is a java software development kit to protect other open
source software licenses. It's intended to provide light weight APIs
for blueprints. Well... at least trying to.
<br>
<br>
There are so many great open source projects now. Back in year 2000,
there were not much to use. Even JDBC drivers were rare back then.
Naturally, I have to implement many things by myself. Especially dynamic
class loading, networking, scripting, logging and database interactions.
It was time consuming. Now I can take my picks from open source
projects.
<br>
<br>
But I still need my own APIs. Most of my clients just don't understand
open source licenses. They always want to have their own versions of
open source projects but don't want to publish derivative works. They
shouldn't use open source projects in the first place. So I need to have
my own open source project to be free from derivation terms and also as
a mediator between other open source projects and my client's
requirements.
<br>
<br>
Primary purpose of blueprint-sdk is not to violate other open source
project's license terms.
<br>
<br>
To committers:
<br>
<br>
License terms of the other software used by your source code should not
be violated by using your source code. That's why blueprint-sdk is made
for. Without that, all your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.
